General visitors are those who are coming to the UK :  for tourism  for a holiday  to visit family  to take part in an archaeological excavation, or  to donate an organ or to be assessed as a suitable organ donor . Organ donors Applicants coming to act as an organ donor or to be assessed as a suitable organ donor are considered under the general visitor rules regardless of whether the intended recipient is being treated on the National Health Service (NHS) or privately. There are no provisions within the Immigration Rules to grant:  Indefinite leave to remain (settlement) in any of the visitor categories.  Someone entry to the UK as a dependant of a visitor. A dependant or family member will need to qualify in their own right in one of the visitor categories.

You must make further enquiries to find out why less than six months was originally given before granting an extension. You must only grant leave to remain for a period beyond six months if one or more of the following criteria are met:  The visitor falls in a category allowed a total stay of up to 12 months. Or  There are compassionate and compelling grounds for the visitor to be in the UK beyond six months, for example the illness of a relative.

Assessing an applicant’s genuine intentions to visit When deciding whether to grant entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain to a visitor, you must be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the applicant meets all the requirements of paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules and are therefore considered to be a genuine visitor. If you are not satisfied, you must refuse their application. It is the applicant’s responsibility to provide evidence to satisfy you that they are a genuine visitor. An absence of evidence may be a cause to refuse an application. You must assess all relevant information provided by the applicant, as well as any external information which may help inform your decision. Assessing an applicant’s personal circumstances In addition to meeting the requirements of the Immigration Rules, the following factors will help you assess if an applicant is a genuine visitor:  Their previous immigration history, including visits to the UK and other countries.  The duration of previous visits and whether this was significantly longer than they originally stated on their visa application. If this is the case, you should not automatically presume that the visitor is non-compliant, but this may be a reason to question the applicant’s overall intentions.  Their financial circumstances as well as their family, social and economic background.  Their personal and economic ties to their country of residence.  The cumulative period of time the applicant has visited the UK and their pattern of travel over the last 12 month period, and assess whether this amounts to ‘de-facto’ residence in the UK.  Whether, in your judgment, the information and the reasons for the visit provided by the applicant are credible and correspond to their personal, family, social and economic background.

This can include the political, economic and security situation. You may use any reputable publicly available information to identify these factors for example, Home Office country information reports, UN reports, EU reports, factual media reporting.  Information on immigration non-compliance by individuals who applied for a visit visa from the same geographical region as the applicant. This can include published statistical information on immigration non-compliance and any other locally held information. Home Office published statistical reports may help with your assessment, see related link: Statistical reports. Whilst this information cannot be used as grounds for refusal alone, it is relevant in determining if the applicant is a genuine visitor. Grounds for doubting the applicant’s genuine intentions to visit the UK This is not an exhaustive list but may help with your assessment:  the applicant has few or no family and economic ties to their country of residence, and has several family members in the UK  the political, economic and security situation in the applicant’s country of residence, including whether it is politically unstable, a conflict zone or at risk of becoming one, which may lead to doubts about their intention to leave the UK at the end of their visit  the applicant, their sponsor (if they are visiting a friend or relative) or other immediate family member has, or has attempted to, deceive the Home Office in a previous application for entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain  there are discrepancies between the statements made by the applicant and the statements made by the sponsor, particularly on points where the sponsor could reasonably be expected to know the facts but does not  it has not been possible to verify information provided by the applicant despite repeated attempts to do so  the information that has been provided or the reasons stated by the applicant are not credible.

A visitor must satisfy the Home Office they:  genuinely intend to stay temporarily in the UK for a specific period and will leave at the end of it, and  do not intend to live in the UK for extensive periods because of frequent, successive visits. You must refuse an application for leave to remain if an applicant has failed to honour any undertakings as to the duration and purpose of their stay. Where a visitor's intentions are in doubt but there is insufficient evidence to refuse leave to enter, full details of the passenger's stated intentions, including any undertakings given orally, must be recorded on the landing card or any other written account of the interview. Undertakings from sponsors Applications for leave to enter are sometimes supported by undertakings or guarantees from sponsors, for example, Members of Parliament, community leaders or other third parties. It may be appropriate and acceptable to take into account promises of maintenance and/or accommodation made by a sponsor. Paragraph 35 of the Immigration Rules allows you to ask a sponsor to give an undertaking in writing that they will be responsible for the applicant’s maintenance and accommodation for the duration of their stay. Paragraph 320(14) allows a person to be refused entry on the grounds that their sponsor has refused to give such an undertaking when requested to do so.

Frequency and duration of visits Visitors cannot live in the UK on a continuous basis, even if they leave the UK for short periods to avoid overstaying. There is no specific limit on the number of visits an individual can make to the UK, such as a definitive rule which states a visitor can only remain in the UK for ‘6 months in a 12 month period’. Visitors, however, must not be living in the UK for extended periods because of frequent, successive visits. For example, where an individual:  spends five or six months in the UK during a visit and returns after a short break in their home country for a further five or six months, or  is living in the UK for successive short periods and breaking this by leaving for a couple of days, for example, someone living in the UK during the week and breaking this by leaving the UK at the weekends. This could amount to genuine residence. However this is not a hard and fast rule and you must consider the circumstances of each case on an individual basis. Assessing residence through successive visits You must consider the following factors to assess whether the visitor is residing in the UK because of frequent, successive visits:  The purpose of the visit and intended length of stay stated on the visitor’s visa application form or to the Border Force officer.  The number of visits made over the past year (rolling 12 month period), including: o the length of stay on each occasion o the time elapsed since the last visit, and o whether this amounts to the individual spending more time in the UK than in their In this section Permissible study Credibility and intentions Undertakings and guarantees Multi-entry visas Employment or study Maintenance and accommodation External links Immigration Rules – Part 2: paragraphs 40-56Z Archived"

Multi-entry visit visas are normally valid for either:  six months  12 months  two years  five years, or  10 years. Visas are valid for an unlimited number of journeys within the validity period of the visa. People holding visit visas can only remain in the UK for a maximum of six months on any one visit, or until the visa expires if less than six months. This restriction is indicated on the visa by the entry ‘180’ days after the ‘Duration of stay’ section. Holders of long-term visit visas must still meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules each time they enter the UK. They must not be using the route to live in the UK for extended periods. If this is the case, Border Force officers must refuse entry to the UK. Unless granted permission by the Home Office, the holder cannot remain in the UK beyond the ‘valid until’ date shown on the visit visa, even when this means their stay in UK will be less than six months.

In considering this you must look at:  the level of funds available to them and anyone with them and if this is enough to cover their expenses for the duration of the visit  what their plans are in the UK and the duration of their stay  what arrangements have already been made for their accommodation. Maintenance and accommodation provided by a sponsor (family or friend) If a visitor is dependant on a sponsor (family or friend) to provide accommodation or financial support during their visit, you must be satisfied the sponsor is:  Legally present in the UK, or legally present at the time of their visit (if they are a visitor themselves).  Able and intending to provide this support for the duration of the visitor’s stay. In particular you must consider: o if the sponsor and visitor have a genuine relationship o where they met o how they maintain communication and how often they communicate, and o the sponsor’s previous history of sponsoring visitors. Previous failure to support visitors may call into question their intention and ability to do so for this application. Accommodation If the sponsor is providing accommodation to the visitor you must consider if there is enough room to adequately house the visitor(s) and any existing residents.

Genetically related donations will be where the donor is a blood relative of the potential applicant. Where the family members have not had an emotional relationship prior to the recipient needing a transplant, care must be taken to consider whether the applicant (donor) is genuinely coming to act as a donor. Emotionally related donors can include potential donors who have had a relationship with the recipient, for example they are their spouse, partner or a close friend. This does not extend to where the donor has not met the recipient before and they have been brought together by a third party, such as a social media campaign. Where the applicant (the donor) is not a member of family they must be able to provide documents that show the relationship is genuine, such as copies of previous correspondence. Where they are unable to prove the relationship or they are only able to provide a small number of documents in support (including where the claimed friendship is relatively recent), you must refer the case to referred casework unit (RCU) for consideration outside of the Immigration Rules. It is an offence for an individual to give or receive any form of reward for organ donation. So, you must make sure the applicant is not receiving payment in order to donate an organ. Where there is reason to believe an applicant is receiving a reward for acting as a donor you must refer the case to RALON. Legally present Where the intended recipient is being treated by the National Health Service (NHS) they will have been established by the relevant NHS trust as being ordinarily resident. However where the recipient is being treated privately no assessment of their status in the UK will have been made. As such, where the recipient is being treated privately you must check that they have the correct legal status to be in the UK.

However due to the nature of their visit, care must be taken when considering who is providing this support for the visitor and their likely expenses in the UK. When assessing whether the applicant (the donor) has sufficient funds, you should note that in the majority of cases the donor will need to be in hospital for the majority of their stay, and therefore their accommodation and maintenance will be provided by the hospital. NHS donors can also be reimbursed for expenses incurred which are directly attributable to being a donor. These can include travel costs and loss of earnings. Payments in this respect are paid as reimbursements after the operation. This means that an applicant must still be able to demonstrate they have sufficient funds to cover any costs in the interim. Accompanying family members Given the nature of the visit we would not normally expect the applicant to be accompanied by family members, especially where these are under the age of 18. The exception to this will be where there is no suitable alternative care for them in their country of residence. Where children are applying to accompany the applicant, you must make sure there are suitable care arrangements in place for the period during which the applicant (their parent(s)) will be in hospital and for any period of recovery when the applicant will be incapacitated. Where entire family groups are coming to the UK (spouses and children) you must carefully consider the impact this has on their likelihood to return at the end of their visit. Consideration process All applications must be assessed under the general visitor rules in the first instance. Where an application meets all of the requirements the application can be approved by the entry clearance manager (ECM) considering the application.

Referral to RCU Where an applicant provides the relevant medical evidence but there are doubts, such as their relationship to the donor, their intention to return home or their funds to support their stay in the UK, you must refer the application to RCU for further consideration outside of the rules. Where the decision is taken to grant outside of the rules, this must be restricted to a single entry visa unless there are strong mitigating factors to support issuing a multi-entry visa. Secondary applications from applicants previously granted in this capacity Where a visitor enters as an NHS donor and is assessed to be an unsuitable match or chooses not to donate, either because they are incompatible with their intended recipient, or prefer a better match, they may choose to pursue a paired or pooled donation. This allows them to be matched with another donor and recipient in the same situation in the National Living Donor Sharing Schemes. The donor organs are then swapped. When two pairs are involved it is a paired donation, and where there are more than two, it is a pooled donation. Where an individual applies for entry clearance on this basis, their application must be referred to RCU for consideration outside the rules. Individuals applying on this basis must provide the relevant medical letter, detailing the arrangements involved and specifying whether this is a pooled or paired donation. The application must be assessed against the general visitor requirements and the additional organ donor requirements (with the exception of the requirement to have genetic or a pre-existing emotional relationship with the direct recipient, although they should still have a connection with someone in the group who is receiving an organ transplant).

There is no specific provision in the Immigration Rules for an individual to be granted a visa to accompany a private medical treatment visitor.

From 6 November 2014, medical visitors can be issued with 11 month visas, where it is known that their treatment is going to take longer than six months. If a friend or family member applies to accompany them as a general visitor, they will be considered against the full requirements of this route. Where there is a compelling need for accompanying friends or family to stay with the medical visitor for the remaining period of their treatment in the UK (for example, beyond the six months the friend of family has been granted), consideration can be given to them outside the Immigration Rules on an individual basis.

In addition to the requirements set out in this guidance, applicants for the Health and Care Visa will need to meet all relevant criteria for a Skilled Worker. These requirements are set out in the Immigrations Rules at Appendix Skilled Worker and Appendix Skilled Occupations, including: • A requirement for applicants to work for a UK employer that’s been approved by the Home Office • Applicants with Certificates of Sponsorship for occupation codes “6135 – Care workers and home carers”, and “6136 – Senior Care Workers” must work for a CQC regulated employer. Where an applicant has already been issued a visa to work for an employer which is not registered with the CQC, under the rules in place before 11 March 2024, they can extend their permission with the same employer. • Where an applicant is switching to this route as a care worker or senior care worker, they must have already been working legally in their job for their sponsor for at least 3 months. • Where an applicant, who originally applied before the rules changed, moves to another sponsor, the new sponsor will need to meet the CQC requirement. • A requirement to have a ‘certificate of sponsorship’ from their employer with information about the role they’ve been offered in the UK • A requirement to do a job that’s on the list of eligible occupations • A requirement to be paid a minimum salary - how much depends on the type of work the applicant does • A requirement to be able to speak, read, write and understand English at the required level. • Transitional arrangements These requirements are contained in this guidance and can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/health-care-worker-visa Employer requirements 5. The employer will be required to include a brief explanation in the Certificate of Sponsorship setting out how the employee meets the Health and Care Visa eligibility requirement set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. The employer will also be responsible for informing the applicant they are eligible for the Health and Care Visa so the applicant can correctly complete the visa application form. Where an employer is an organisation that provides services commissioned by the NHS, evidence of the contract arrangements with the NHS may need to be provided to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) as proof that applicants are eligible to apply for a Health and Care Visa. Visa fee reduction 6. Individuals applying for the Health and Care Visa will apply using the normal Skilled Worker application form and, assuming their employer has confirmed how the employee is eligible, the applicant will check the box to confirm they are applying for the Health and Care Visa."

All visa application fees, including for the Health and Care Visa, can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table. Once they have completed all the relevant information, the application process should automatically route Health and Care Visa applicants to the payment page where the appropriate fee will be applied. 7. The visa fee reduction applies to partners and dependants of Health and Care Visa applicants. Partners and dependants of Health and Care Visa applicants should therefore also tick this box. 8. You should not tick the Health and Care Visa box if your employer has not confirmed on the Certificate of Sponsorship that you are eligible. Where an application is made, but the applicant does not appear to meet the conditions, that application may be rejected (as the correct fee will not have been paid). If you are unsure you should check with your sponsor before completing the application. 9. If you are applying as a partner or dependant of a person who qualifies for the Health and Care Visa, but the qualifying person arrived in the UK before the Health and Care Visa was available, then you will need confirmation from the sponsor that the person upon whom your application is reliant, is eligible for the visa. The sponsor will need to provide the information, which would normally be included in the Certificate of Sponsorship, to the applicant for inclusion in the partner or dependant application. This should be in the form of a letter or an email from the sponsor and would set out the organisation and, if not an NHS body, how the organisation qualifies under paragraph 2 of this guidance. 10. If you are sponsored in SOC code 6135 – Care workers and home carers, or 6136 – Senior Care Workers, you will be unable to include your partner or dependant in your visa to come to or stay in the UK. This restriction does not apply to Skilled Worker or Health and Care visa holders who had visas issued for applications submitted before 11 March 2024 and have since held continuous permission in the route, or if the dependent is a child born in the UK. 11. In addition to the reduced visa fee, applicants applying for the Health and Care Visa, and their family are exempt from having to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge. Family is defined as the partner or dependant child of the person applying for the Health and Care Visa. It does not cover wider family or those living independently of the health and Care visa applicant. Fast-Track entry 12. UKVI will prioritise Health and Care Visa applications, with the aim that the vast majority are processed within three weeks from the point the applicant has provided their biometric information. This is in comparison to the current timeframe for visa processing of between eight and twenty weeks."

        "content": "English language courses up to 11 months This page tells you about English language courses that an applicant can be granted permission to study on the Short-term Student (English Language) route. For the purpose of this route, ‘English language study’ is a course that teaches English as a foreign language only and does not include other subjects. An applicant cannot study mixed courses under this route. You must refuse any other applications for any other type of course. You must check that the applicant has been accepted for a course of study at an accredited institution. They must provide an acceptance letter from the institution with details of the course. Students are able to extend their course up to a maximum of 11 months, provided the student is studying at the same institution. For example, if a student originally applies for an English Language course of 7 months in length, but once they have been granted permission wishes to extend that course to 11 months with the same provider, this is permitted. A student is not permitted to switch to a different provider, or switch onto a different course with their current provider. Applicants for entry clearance on the Short-term Student (English Language) route must meet all the requirements of paragraphs STS 3.1 to STS 7.2 of the Immigration Rules, see: Eligibility requirements for Short-term Student (English Language) route.

A short-term student must be accepted on and study an English course provided by an accredited institution. An accredited institution is defined as an institution that meets one of the following requirements: • is a licensed Student sponsor listed on the Student sponsor register • holds valid accreditation from: o Accreditation UK o the British Accreditation Council (BAC) o the Accreditation Service for International Colleges (ASIC) • holds a valid and satisfactory full institutional inspection by one of the following bodies: o Estyn o Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education o Education Scotland o Office for Students (OfS) o the Independent Schools Inspectorate o Ofsted o the Education and Training Inspectorate Northern Ireland • is an overseas higher education institution which offers only part of its programmes in the UK To check that an overseas institution is an overseas higher education institution, as defined in paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules, you must check that it offers programmes equivalent to UK degrees, by checking the Ecctis (formerly UK NARIC) website.

        "content": "Evidence This section gives information on how to make a decision on a Short-term Student (English Language) application. Standard and burden of proof and evidence When assessing whether the applicant meets the requirements of the Short-term Student (English Language) rules, the burden of proof is on the applicant to show they meet the validity and eligibility requirements. However, when considering suitability, the burden of proof may shift to the Home Office. It is the applicant’s responsibility to ensure they provide sufficient evidence to satisfy you that they meet the Short-term Student (English Language) rules, including the genuine Short-term Student requirement. The standard of proof you must apply is the balance of probabilities (which means it is more likely than not). In certain circumstances it may be appropriate for you to contact the applicant to clarify existing documentation or to provide further supporting information. For when to apply evidential flexibility, see guidance: evidential flexibility. Supporting documents should be consistent with statements made on the visa application form. For example, where the applicant has provided a bank statement demonstrating their financial circumstances this should not contradict statements made regarding the applicant’s income and sources of funds for their studies stated on their application form. If you have concerns about the genuineness of a document, you should try to verify it at source. See guidance: document verification checks. When making a decision on a Short-term Student application, you must assess the applicant’s credibility and intentions from which you must be satisfied that the applicant is a genuine Short-term Student. See guidance: genuine Short-term Student requirement. You must assess all the information provided by the applicant as well as any other evidence that may be relevant to the application. This should include any locally held information. You must make an overall assessment of the application considering all factors relevant to the application. Related content Contents"

        "content": "Genuine Short-term Student requirement This section tells you how to decide whether an applicant meets the genuine Short- term Student requirement of the Short-term Student (English Language) rules in paragraph STS 5.1. To consider an applicant as having met the genuine Short-term Student requirement, you must be satisfied that they meet all of the criteria listed in paragraph STS 5.1 as follows: • they are genuinely seeking entry for the purpose of undertaking the course of study which they have demonstrated they have been accepted onto as per paragraph STS 4.2 (the course must also be provided by an accredited institution – see: Accredited Institutions) • they will not study in the UK other than for the course of study which they have demonstrated they have been accepted onto as per STS 4.2 • they will not study at an academy or state-funded school • they will leave the UK within 30 days of the end of their course, or at the end of 11 months, whichever is sooner • they will not make the UK their main home • they will not work in the UK • they will not engage in any business or professional activities in the UK • they have relied upon funds to meet the Financial Requirement in STS 6.1-STS 6.4, which are genuinely available to them for the purposes of undertaking their course of study Where you are not satisfied that the applicant has met all of the criteria set out in STS 5.1, you must refuse their application. If an applicant is assessed as not meeting the requirements of being a genuine Short-term Student under STS 5.1, this is distinct and separate from suitability under Part Suitability. When refusing the application under the genuine Short-term Student requirement, you must refer to each of the individual criteria in STS 5.1 that you are not satisfied has been met. You must also clearly set out why you are not satisfied that each criteria quoted on the refusal notice has been met by the applicant. For example, you may not be satisfied that the person intends to leave the UK within the required time frame. You must set out clear reasons why you are not satisfied that the applicant will leave within the required time frame, on the balance of probabilities. Assessing personal circumstances The following factors will help you assess if an applicant is a genuine Short-term Student:"

While not exhaustive, the following list of considerations may altogether help you determine whether the requirement at STS 5.1(a) has been met. • why the applicant is intending to undertake this course and how it relates to their personal circumstances in their home country • the prospective level of English Language proficiency the applicant will obtain at the end of the proposed course - particularly in comparison to their current English language ability or: o the previous qualifications attained in English Language • how much of the total course fees have already been paid • the distance between the applicant’s intended accommodation and the education provider’s address • whether the cost of the course and stay in the UK is commensurate with the applicant’s plans after they leave the UK • whether the cost of the course and stay in the UK is commensurate with the applicant’s declared current income and expenditure as well as the wider financial circumstances of the applicant and their immediate family"

        "content": "Assessing the genuine availability of funds Under STS 5.1(h) you must be satisfied that the funds relied on by the applicant to meet the financial requirements in STS 6.1-STS 6.4 are and will remain genuinely available to the applicant, for the purpose of covering the costs related to undertaking their studies in the UK. The financial documents provided by the applicant to meet the requirements at STS 6.1-STS 6.4 should be reflective of the information provided on their application form (such as their income and expenditure in their country of residence, their savings, and if they have received financial support from anyone else – such as family or friends towards the cost of their stay). Where the source of funds relied upon by the applicant, as demonstrated in their financial documentation, is not credible, indicates an intention to settle in the UK, or is otherwise inconsistent with what has been declared on their current application form or recent previous applications or other documentation provided by the applicant in their current application (such as employment contracts or payslips), an applicant is unlikely to meet this requirement. Previous travel You must consider the applicant’s travel history in their passport or travel document and that are listed on the application form. A pattern of travel that shows the applicant has previously complied with UK immigration law may indicate the applicant is likely to be a genuine Short-term Student, as might travel to other countries, especially the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland or Schengen countries. However, the Short-term Student (English Language) visa must not be used to make the UK the applicant’s main home. You must also consider whether the applicant’s previous pattern of travel from visits to the UK amounts to ‘de-facto’ residence in the UK. If an applicant has previously failed to comply with another country’s immigration law, for example if they have been removed from another country, or if they have been refused entry to another country, this may suggest that an applicant is not likely to be a genuine short-term Student (depending on the circumstances). Travel history should not be the only consideration in deciding whether you are satisfied an applicant is a genuine short-term Student. There may have been a change in circumstances since previous travel. You should consider all relevant information for each application including any social and economic factors and any locally held information. Where the applicant is a first-time traveller, you will need to rely on other evidence to satisfy you they are a genuine Short-term Student."

        "content": "Frequent or successive study A student is likely to be considered as intending to study in the UK for extended periods through: • successive use of the route if, for example: o the student is seeking a second period of 11 months permission under the Short-term Study (English Language) route where less than 1 year has passed since they last left the UK / having last visited the UK for the purposes of short-term study • frequent use of the route if, for example: o the student is applying for multiple periods of permission under the Short- term Student (English Language) route within a 5-year period Where an application meets either of the above criteria, this will not automatically result in a refusal. You must consider the evidence as a whole to decide if the applicant is a genuine Short-term Student. You must be satisfied that, where the student seeks to spend multiple periods in the UK as a Short-term Student, the frequent or successive study periods do not mean they are studying a course that lasts longer than 11 months. If a student is looking to utilise the Short-term Student (English Language) route on multiple occasions, a student would generally be expected to be studying towards a higher level of English Language proficiency against the Common European Framework of Reference for Language (CEFR) such as B1 level on the first instance then B2 level on the second instance. However, there may be circumstances where an applicant requires a further period of study at the same level, for example a student who hasn’t achieved the English proficiency in the previous application. Examples which may raise doubt of the applicant’s genuineness This is not an exhaustive list but may help with your overall assessment of a Short- term Student application: • the supporting documentation and the reasons for undertaking the course stated by the applicant are not credible • there are discrepancies between the statements made by the applicant and their submitted documentation, locally held information or their previous applications • there is evidence to suggest that the applicant intends to take up work / self- employment / professional business activity / additional studies outside of the course included on their application in the UK – for example: o when mentioned by the applicant in an interview / on the application form, or in supporting documentation such as employment / character reference letters / business documents • the applicant’s previous immigration history application form or documentation indicates they are likely intending on staying in the UK beyond 30 days from their course completion date or a period of 11 months- whichever is sooner"

The caseworker can find out what type of evidence the applicant is relying on by checking the application form. If the applicant is relying on funds from a third party, then the caseworker should check the relationship between the applicant and the third party and if it is unclear, consider contacting the applicant to ask for further information. Caseworkers should also take a fair and proportionate approach to the assessment of evidence.

        "content": "Overview of the Skilled Worker route This section provides an introduction to the Skilled Worker route. The Skilled Worker route is for European Economic Area (EEA) nationals and non- EEA nationals who are sponsored to do a specific skilled job for a Home Office licensed sponsor. Note that throughout this document, references to EEA nationals include Swiss nationals and excludes Irish nationals. Irish nationals have a specific status in the UK under section 3ZA of the Immigration Act 1971. Full details are set out in the Irish citizens section of this guidance. Dependent partners and children can apply on this route (with some exceptions for dependants of care workers, senior care workers and medium skilled roles) as set out in the dependants guidance. Non-POISE users can find the externally published version of this guidance on GOV.UK. The route can lead to settlement in the UK. The route replaces the Tier 2 (General) route. Existing Tier 2 (General) workers can apply for extensions, changes of employment and settlement under the Skilled Worker route. Requirements The requirements applicants must meet are split into 3 parts: • validity requirements - these outline the minimum criteria which must be met for the application to be considered fully - they ensure, for example: the applicant has used the correct form and supplied their identity documents - applications which do not meet these requirements are invalid and may be rejected • suitability requirements – these check the suitability of the applicant to be granted any form of permission, not specifically whether they qualify as a Skilled Worker - applicants must not fall for refusal on general grounds or be in breach of immigration laws - applications which do not meet these requirements must be refused • eligibility requirements – these are the main criteria specific to the Skilled Worker route - applications which do not meet these requirements must be refused The table below sets out the paragraphs in Appendix Skilled Worker for each of these requirements: Application Validity Suitability Eligibility Main applicants – entry clearance and permission to stay SW 1.1. to SW 1.6. SW 2.1. to SW 2.2. SW 3.1. to SW 16.2. Main applicants – settlement SW 19.1. to SW 19.4. SW 20.1. to SW 20.2. SW 21.1. to SW 24.4."

To award these points, you must be satisfied the application meets the requirements in paragraphs SW 5.1. to SW 5.7. Valid certificate of sponsorship A certificate of sponsorship (CoS) is only valid if certain requirements are met. The CoS assigned to the applicant must meet all the requirements set out in paragraph SW 5.1. You should contact the sponsor to request any missing details (in particular, the employer PAYE (pay as you earn) reference number the applicant will be assigned to may be missing if the CoS was assigned before the launch of the Skilled Worker route). If the application is for entry clearance, the CoS must be a “Defined CoS”. This means the sponsor has requested it for the specific job and salary shown and has not assigned it from their general allocation. Licensed sponsor The sponsor must hold a valid Skilled Worker sponsor licence. The sponsor must also be A-rated, unless the applicant is applying for an extension to continue working for the same sponsor. See the sponsorship guidance for more details. You must confirm these requirements are met by accessing the Certificate of Sponsorship Checking System. You can contact the Sponsor Licensing Unit (SLU) to find out more information about the status of a sponsor’s licence if needed. If the applicant’s sponsor loses its licence while the application is under consideration, you have a duty to inform the applicant promptly. You must only inform the applicant their sponsor no longer has a licence, not the reasons why. The only exception is if the licence was revoked for reasons directly linked to this application, and those reasons therefore have particular relevance to the refusal – for example: you are refusing on genuine vacancy grounds, as well as the fact the sponsor is no longer licensed.

The sponsor must be currently carrying out activities regulated by the CQC and must not be ‘dormant’ on their register or have requested to become ‘dormant’. This includes if they are employed as a care worker or senior care worker before the 11 March 2024 but are applying to switch to a different employer. Where a sponsor has confirmed the applicant will be working at an address in England you must check the Care Quality Commission search results to see if the sponsor is conducting activities which are regulated by the CQC. The CQC is the independent regulator of health and adult social care in England. This does not apply to applicants who will be working solely in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. However, an applicant who will be working, for example partly in England and partly in Scotland, is subject to the requirement, even if their main work location is in Scotland and the England location is a smaller proportion of their job. However, care workers or senior care workers who were sponsored in those roles before 11 March 2024 do not need to be employed by a sponsor who is registered with the Care Quality Commission if they are applying to extend their visa with the same sponsor. To be eligible for this exemption, their original Skilled Worker application date must have been before 11 March 2024 (even if that application was granted after 11 March). The worked examples below set out how to consider applications for permission to work as ‘6135 – Care workers and home carers’, and ‘6136 – Senior Care Workers’ submitted on or after 11 March 2024. Worked examples Example 1 An applicant was previously granted permission in 2022 to work for a sponsor in England which is not registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). They are now applying to extend their permission with this sponsor. They can extend their permission with that sponsor. This includes where an applicant is changing between care worker and senior care worker. Example 2 An applicant was previously granted permission in 2022 to work for a sponsor in England which is not registered with the CQC.

Working for third parties Where a Skilled Worker is being supplied to one organisation by another organisation, their sponsor must be whoever has full responsibility for the duties, functions and outcomes, or outputs of the job. For example: company A has a contract with a client - company Z - to deliver an IT solution within agreed timescales. An applicant, who is sponsored by company A to work on that project, may be sent to work for the length of the contract at company Z’s premises, but they remain employed by company A throughout the period of the contract. As company A is responsible for their duties, functions, outputs or outcomes, company A must be the applicant’s sponsor. A sponsor can only assign a CoS if they have full responsibility for deciding the duties, functions and outcomes or outputs of the job. Where the applicant is carrying out work for a third party on their sponsor’s behalf, they must be contracted by their sponsor to provide a time-bound, non-routine service or project on their sponsor’s behalf. This means a service or project which has a specific end date, after which it will have ended, or the service provided will no longer be operated by their sponsor or anyone else. It also means an applicant must not be either: • hired to a third party who is not the sponsor to fill a position with that party, whether temporary or permanent (for example: an agency worker filling a vacancy with a third-party) • engaging in contract work to undertake an ongoing routine role or to provide an ongoing routine service for a third party who is not their sponsor, regardless of the nature or length of any arrangement between the sponsor and the third party Compliance with specified employment regulations You must not award points for sponsorship if you have reasonable grounds to believe the job the applicant is being sponsored to do does not comply with either the National Minimum Wage Regulations or the Working Time Regulations If the job meets the salary requirements for the route, it is likely the salary will be compliant with the National Minimum Wage Regulations. However, the regulations include provisions which go further than the Skilled Worker salary requirements.

If a sponsor claims an exemption applies to any of these protections, you can ask for an explanation and refuse the application if you are not satisfied: • holiday entitlement • rest breaks at work • night working hours The guidance linked to above may help you in assessing cases against both sets of regulations. Warning signs to be aware of include: • long shifts without the daily or weekly rest breaks which workers would normally be entitled to • claims that work is ‘unmeasured’ for either or both sets of regulations • average hours agreements which seem unrealistic in the context of the job • large deductions from salary, for accommodation or other reasons These signs are more frequently seen in relation to ‘live in’ roles, such as care workers or domestic staff. However, you should be mindful that both sets of regulations are complex and there are several exemptions that may apply to an individual case.

On 22 July 2025, the skill threshold increased to Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) level 6, with exceptions for certain shortage occupations and workers already in the route. To be eligible, an occupation code must be: • Skilled to RQF level 6 – these occupation codes are listed in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations • on the Immigration Salary List (ISL) in Appendix Immigration Salary List • on the Temporary Shortage List (TSL) in SW 6.1B in Appendix Skilled Worker • skilled to RQF level 3-5, if the applicant qualifies under transitional arrangements for those in the route before 22 July 2025 – these occupation codes are listed in Table 1a, Table 2aa and Table 3a of Appendix Skilled Occupations • previously considered to be RQF level 3, if the applicant qualifies under transitional arrangements for those in the route before 4 April 2024 – these occupation codes are listed in Table 2a of Appendix Skilled Occupations For some occupation codes, jobs are only on the ISL if either or both of the following apply: • they meet additional criteria (which may include certain jobs, experience, salary and / or other requirements) • the job is based in a particular nation (or nations) of the UK The certificate of sponsorship (CoS) must confirm the job is on the ISL and, where there are additional criteria in Appendix Immigration Salary List, those criteria are met. Where relevant, you should use the ‘working at’ address to determine which UK nation the job is based in. You should seek further information from the sponsor, if it is unclear from the CoS whether the job is on the ISL or TSL. For example: if some jobs in the occupation code are on one of the lists and others are not. Or if the job might be on one of the lists, but it is not clear from the job title and the sponsor has not indicated this in the CoS. You should contact the sponsor to confirm and if so – in the case of jobs on the ISL – you should make refund arrangements for the fee difference. There are no reduced fees applicable to the TSL. The transitional arrangements in (d) apply to people granted permission under the rules in place before 22 July 2025 who have held continuous permission since that point (except that where the Exceptions for Overstayers section of Part Suitability applies, that period of overstaying will be disregarded)."

The occupation codes listed in Table 1 and Table 2 are identical, as are the occupation codes listed in Table 1a and Table 2aa. The difference between the tables is in the going rates (see Assessing tradeable points). You must not award points for a job at the appropriate skill level if you are not also awarding the 20 mandatory points for sponsorship. Exaggerated or incorrect occupation codes You must not award points for a job at the appropriate skill level if you have reasonable grounds to believe the sponsor has not chosen an appropriate occupation code. Factors which may indicate this could include when either: • the job description appears to be a standard or template response used for other businesses and the application is in a high-risk sector • the applicant has been refused previously on similar grounds This is not an exhaustive list. The SOC2020 coding system is a live document and is subject to change. You will need to assess applications based on the most up to date coding. This should be done using the CASCOT occupational coding tool. A sponsor may have chosen a less appropriate occupation code either by accidental error or intentionally. You should request additional information where you have concerns (see Requesting more information), to give the sponsor an opportunity to correct any accidental error and / or address any questions about whether they have misrepresented the job. The duties of a particular job may mean there is more than one plausible choice of standard occupational classification (SOC) code. Sponsors should choose the code which most closely fits, or which contains the duties the applicant will spend the most time doing. If a decision as to which is the most appropriate SOC code is finely balanced, sponsors should normally be given the benefit of doubt, unless there is a reason not to, such as those set out below. You should consider whether the sponsor has chosen a less appropriate occupation code for any of the following reasons: • to make a job which is not at the appropriate skill level appear more skilled • to be able to pay the applicant a lower going rate • to qualify for tradeable points for a job in an occupation on the Immigration Salary List • to qualify for tradeable points for a relevant PhD qualification To support this assessment, you may consider:"

Sponsors should confirm on the applicant’s certificate of sponsorship (CoS) whether the ATAS requirement applies. A field will be added to the CoS to confirm this but now, it needs to be set out in a sponsor note. If the first 3 bullet points above apply, but the sponsor has not provided a note to say whether the ATAS requirement applies and the applicant has not provided an ATAS certificate, you should contact the sponsor to confirm whether the requirement applies. If the sponsor fails to provide the necessary confirmation, you should not award points for sponsorship (paragraph SW 5.1(f)). If the sponsor confirms the ATAS requirement applies and the applicant has not provided an ATAS certificate, you should consider contacting the applicant (see Requesting more information). Processing an ATAS application takes at least 20 working days and can take 30 or more working days between April and September. You should allow the standard 10 working days for the applicant to respond but consider extending the deadline if the applicant confirms they have submitted their ATAS application and are waiting for a response. If an applicant does not provide a copy of a valid ATAS certificate when required, you should not award points for a job at an appropriate skill level (paragraph SW 6.3A).

        "content": "Assessing tradeable points This section tells you how to assess tradeable points for Skilled Workers. The application process will ask applicants and sponsors to provide all relevant information which might attract tradeable points. It is possible for applicants to score tradeable points in more than one way (although they cannot mix and match different options). This does not mean you necessarily need to consider every option fully in every application. You should first consider the mandatory points for sponsorship and a skilled job, including which skills threshold (RQF 6 or RQF 3) applies and any transitional arrangements. Then you should consider whether the occupation code is a health or education occupation using national pay scales, in Table 3 or 3a of Appendix Skilled Occupations, and therefore falls under option K. The table below summarises which tables of Appendix Skilled Occupations apply in which cases: Tradeable points option RQF 6 threshold RQF 3 threshold A to E Table 1 Tables 1 and 1a F to J Table 2 Tables 2 and 2aa (and 2a in some transitional cases) K Table 3 Tables 3 and 3a Salary should be considered next, then (in the case of options A to J) any other information which could attract tradeable points. Are the sponsorship and skilled job requirements met? All the tradeable points options rely on the applicant having a valid certificate of sponsorship (CoS) and a genuine job which meets the skills threshold. You must not award tradeable points if you are not awarding the 20 mandatory points for sponsorship and / or the 20 mandatory points for a job at an appropriate skill level. You do not need to assess tradeable points further if an application falls for refusal for these reasons. Occupations in Tables 1, 1a, 2, 2aa and 2a The majority of occupation codes (those which do not apply national pay scales) eligible for the Skilled Worker route are listed in Tables 1, 1a, 2, 2aa and 2a of Appendix Skilled Occupations. The same occupations appear in Tables 1 and 2, and 1a and 2aa, but different going rates are shown to reflect the different tradeable points options."

Tradeable points options F to J (also detailed above) attract the going rates listed in Tables 2, 2aa and 2a. If the occupation is listed in Tables 1 to 2a, you must assess all the tradeable points options until you find one where the applicant can be awarded 20 points, or until you have exhausted all the options and the application falls for refusal. For occupations listed in Tables 3 and 3a of Appendix Skilled Occupations, see: Occupations in Tables 3 and 3a. It is recommended you assess the tradeable points options firstly by assessing salary (which applies to all tradeable points options). The “Assessing salaries” section explains which tradeable points options to consider further, depending on the salary. In doing so, you must consider all the available information and seek further information from the applicant or their sponsor where appropriate. You do not, however, need to make contact speculatively if there is nothing in the current application to indicate an applicant may meet the requirements of a tradeable points option or if they score the required 20 tradeable points in another way. If tradeable points cannot be awarded under any of options A to J, your decision must also show you have considered option K (and awarded 0 tradeable points under it, as the job is not in an eligible occupation for that option). Occupations in Tables 3 and 3a Some health and education occupation codes are listed in Tables 3 and 3a of Appendix Skilled Occupations. The going rates for these occupations are taken from national pay scales and no discounts to the going rates are available. If an applicant is being sponsored in an occupation code in Table 3 or 3a, they can only score tradeable points based on option K. You do not need to assess other tradeable points options but, if refusing, the decision letter must state clearly the applicant is not eligible under the other options because of their occupation code.

        "content": "Assessing salaries This section explains how to assess salaries for Skilled Workers. For each tradeable points option, sponsors must pay applicants whichever is the higher of the following: • the relevant general threshold • the going rate (subject to any permitted reductions) What to include Under paragraphs SW 14.1. to SW 14.2., you can generally only include guaranteed basic gross pay. You can also include other payments, such as London weighting, but only where the sponsor has confirmed they are guaranteed and are treated the same as basic gross pay for tax, pension and national insurance purposes. No other pay and benefits must be included when assessing salary. Examples of pay and benefits which are not included are listed in paragraph SW 14.2. This is not an exhaustive list. Paragraph SW 14.2A sets out how to consider deductions from salaries and money paid by the applicant to the sponsor. Generally, such amounts must be subtracted when considering salaries. This includes (but is not limited to) cases where it appears the applicant is subsidising their own salary or the sponsor’s immigration costs. However, this should not be subtracted if both the following apply: • the payment is not related to business costs, immigration costs or investment • the applicant has genuinely chosen to give up part of their basic pay for additional benefits as part of a salary sacrifice scheme Paragraph SW 14.5(a) sets out a transitional arrangement for Tier 2 (General) migrants. Their salaries can continue to include allowances, providing all the following conditions are met: • they are applying to extend with the same sponsor • the date of application is before 1 December 2026 • the allowances are guaranteed • the allowances will be paid for the duration of the applicant’s permission (one- off bonuses are not included and cannot be pro-rated) • the allowances would be paid to a local settled worker in similar circumstances (such as London weighting, even where it is not treated the same as basic gross pay for tax, pension and national insurance purposes) Where a sponsor has listed these types of allowances, but the transitional arrangement does not apply, the sponsor may be unaware of the rules changes on allowances.

        "content": "to amend the salary and allowances package, if this could alter the decision on the application. The general threshold The general threshold is the minimum salary which applies regardless of the applicant’s occupation code. This may be £41,700, £37,500, £33,400, £31,300, £28,200 or £25,000 depending on the tradeable points option and whether transitional arrangements apply. Note that the lower general thresholds of £31,300, £28,200 and £25,000 (tradeable points options F to J) are only available to individuals who are either: • applying for the Health and Care visa in an occupation which does not use national pay scales to determine their going rate (as those are covered separately by option K) • whose application was before 4 April 2030, were granted permission as a Skilled Worker under the rules in place before 4 April 2024 and have had continuous permission as a Skilled Worker since then For further detail on these transitional arrangements see the section on ‘Awarding tradeable points for salary’ below (see SW 4.2.) The general salary threshold of £25,000 (option K) is also available to individuals who are applying for a salary and a job in a listed health or education occupation, listed in Tables 3 and 3a of Appendix Skilled Worker. The general threshold is the same, regardless of how many hours a week the applicant is sponsored to work. It cannot be pro-rated for part-time work. However, if the applicant is being sponsored to work more than 48 hours a week, only the salary for the first 48 hours a week can be considered. For example: if the applicant is sponsored to work 60 hours a week for £12.50 per hour, they will be considered to have a salary of £31,200 (£12.50 x 48 x 52) per year and not £39,000 (£12.50 x 60 x 52). The exception to this is if the applicant’s working hours are not the same each week. In these cases, more than 48 hours in some weeks can be considered towards the salary thresholds, providing the average over a regular cycle (which can be less than, but not more than, 17 weeks) is not more than 48 hours a week. For example: an applicant who works a pattern of 60 hours a week for £18.75 per hour for 2 weeks, followed by an unpaid rest week, will be considered to work 40 hours a week on average and have a salary of £39,000 (£18.75 x 40 x 52) per year. Any unpaid rest weeks in these cases will count towards the average when considering whether the salary thresholds are met. They will not count as unpaid absences from employment."

        "content": "The going rate The going rate is the minimum salary which applies for a particular occupation code. The going rates are set out in Appendix Skilled Occupations. Depending on the tradeable points option, applicants must be paid either the full going rate, or 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate. These reductions are not permitted for applicants sponsored in occupation codes listed in Tables 3 or 3a of Appendix Skilled Occupations. Jobs on the Temporary Shortage List do not have a going rate discount but may qualify by meeting other tradable points requirements. Going rates must be pro-rated based on the weekly working hours stated on the certificate of sponsorship (CoS). The going rates in Tables 1, 1a, 2, 2aa and 2a of Appendix Skilled Occupations are based on a 37.5-hour week. Hourly rates are shown in brackets. To avoid rounding errors, you should pro-rate the going rate based on the annual figure, rather than the hourly figure. You do this by dividing the annual going rate by 37.5, then multiplying by the weekly hours stated by the sponsor. For example: if the annual going rate is £39,000 and the applicant is sponsored to work a 25-hour week, the pro-rating calculation would be: £39,000 ÷ 37.5 x 25 = £26,000 The going rates in Tables 3 and 3a of Appendix Skilled Occupations are, unless noted, based on a 40 - hour week (doctors), a 37.5 - hour week (NHS Agenda for Change occupations), various different hours as stated (dentists) or the definition of a full-time worker (teaching occupations). The pro-rating calculation must be adjusted accordingly, for example dividing by 40 rather than by 37.5. For teaching occupations (where weekly working hours are not consistent throughout the year, due to term dates), you should ask the sponsor to confirm what proportion of a full- time equivalent (FTE) the applicant is, and pro-rate the going rate accordingly. The applicant’s full weekly hours must be included when checking their salary against the going rate, even if they work more than 48 - hours a week. For example: an applicant who works 60 - hours a week in an occupation code with a going rate of £45,000 must be paid £72,000 (£45,000 ÷ 37.5 x 60), not £57,600 (£ 45,000 ÷ 37.5 x 48). If the applicant’s salary is less than the pro-rated going rate, and they are being sponsored in an occupation code listed in Tables 1, 1a, 2, 2a a or Table 2 a of Appendix Skilled Occupations, you must calculate what percentage of the going rate they are being paid. This is so you can determine which (if any) tradeable points options they may be eligible for. The worked example below shows how to do this. Worked example The going rate: worked example An applicant’s salary is £42,500, including £2,000 allowances."

They may, however, still be able to score tradeable points from options which include the lower £37,500, £31,300, £28,200 or £25,000 general thresholds. The going rate for the occupation code is £31,500 for a 37.5-hour week. For the going rate, all the weekly hours must be included when pro-rating. The pro- rated going rate is therefore: £31,500 ÷ 37.5 x 54 = £45,360 The applicant’s salary of £40,500 is less than this, so you must calculate the percentage of the going rate they are paid: £40,500 ÷ £45,360 x 100 = 89% (rounded) Because the applicant is only being paid 89% of the going rate, they cannot score tradeable points from options which require them to be paid the full going rate or 90% of the going rate. They may, however, still be able to score tradeable points from options which include 70% or 80% of the going rate.

Paragraph SW 14.5(c) sets out the new transitional arrangements for these applicants. Following the adoption of the standard occupational classification (SOC) 2020 coding system on 4 April 2024 SOC codes for these occupations have been changed.

Eligible occupations Not all occupations are eligible for tradeable points for a relevant PhD qualification. You should check the “Eligible for PhD points (SW)?” column in Tables 1, 1a, 2 and 2aa of Appendix Skilled Occupations. If the applicant’s occupation code is not listed with a ‘yes’ in this column, you do not need to consider these options any further. The occupation codes listed as being eligible for PhD points are all those where the first 2 digits are: • 11 • 21 • 22 • 23 • 24 • 31 (Occupation codes beginning with ‘12’ are not included in this list.) Checking qualifications If the applicant is relying on a recognised qualification awarded by a UK institution, they are asked to provide a copy of their certificate. An academic reference, together with an explanation why the certificate is unavailable, may also be accepted. Acceptable reasons for the certificate not being available could include the certificate not having been issued yet, or the university being unable to replace a lost or damaged certificate. If the applicant is relying on a recognised qualification awarded by an overseas institution, Ecctis (formerly UK NARIC) must have verified it as genuine and equivalent to a UK PhD. The sponsor must state the Ecctis reference number on the certificate of sponsorship (CoS). You must check the Ecctis UKVI Verification Portal. You will be asked to input the applicant’s Ecctis reference number and date of birth. The portal will return one of four outcomes. It will also return the UK equivalency of the qualifications. Only “PHD” will be an acceptable equivalency. Outcome What it means Casework action ‘Verified as genuine’ and equivalency is ‘PHD’ Qualification is genuine and meets the standard of a UK PhD.

ISL occupations are listed in Appendix Immigration Salary List. For some occupation codes, jobs are only on the ISL if either or both of the following apply: • they meet additional criteria (which may include certain jobs, experience, salary - other requirements) • the job is based in a particular nation (or nations) of the UK The certificate of sponsorship (CoS) must confirm the job is on the ISL and, where there are additional criteria in Appendix Immigration Salary List, those criteria are met. Where relevant, you should use the ‘working at’ address to determine which UK nation the job is based in. You should seek further information from the sponsor, if it is unclear from the CoS whether the job is on the ISL. For example: if some jobs in the occupation code are on the ISL and others are not. Or if the job might be on the ISL, but it is not clear from the job title and the sponsor has not marked this in the CoS. You should contact the sponsor to confirm and if so, you should make refund arrangements for the fee difference. Unlike under Tier 2 (General), there is no minimum number of weekly hours for ISL occupations in the Skilled Worker route, providing the relevant general salary threshold requirements are met and the ‘going rate’ salary requirements are met when pro-rated. The ISL is different to the Temporary Shortage List (TSL). Being on the TSL allows an entry clearance application to be made where the occupations is medium skilled (RQF 3-5) and not highly skilled. It does not give any other benefits, such as to salary, and therefore does not make an occupation eligible for tradeable points options D or I. Fees Skilled Worker application fees are lower for applicants with a job on the Immigration Salary List (ISL). If an applicant has paid the lower fee, but cannot score points for a job on the ISL, you should contact the applicant and advise them: • they cannot score points for a job on the ISL • if they wish to be considered for other tradeable points, they will need to pay a top-up to the (non-ISL) Skilled Worker fee • if no top-up is paid, they will not be considered for other tradeable points"

There is no lower fee for jobs on the Temporary Shortage List. Jobs removed from the Immigration Salary List If the applicant was last granted permission for a job on the Immigration Salary List (ISL) and the job is no longer included in Appendix Immigration Salary List for the relevant UK nation, you can still award tradeable points for a job in on the ISL. However, they must be applying to continue working in the same job (allowing any changes which would not have made a difference to whether the job was on the list) for the same sponsor. While the tradeable points apply in such cases, the discount to the application fee does not. The applicant must pay the normal (non-ISL) fee. If they are applying to work for a different sponsor, they will need to score tradeable points in another way.

However, the newer condition should be considered as applying to anyone with existing Skilled Worker permission, regardless of their grant date. If the Skilled Worker is a General Practice (GP) trainee, who is granted permission until 4 Months after the end date on their CoS (see Dates of permission granted below), they can do supplementary work during these 4 months, even if they are no longer working for their sponsor.

Secondary employment A Skilled Worker can apply to do a second (additional) job that does not qualify as supplementary employment. For example: it requires more than 20 hours work a week. They will need a new CoS for this second job and must apply for a variation of permission, in addition to the certificate and permission for their existing job. This is because working in the second job is not covered by their existing conditions.

Rights of appeal and administrative review If an application for permission to stay is refused, applicants cannot exercise a right of appeal in country. However, if they think the Home Office has made an error in considering their application, they can apply for an administrative review. Details of how to make an administrative review application must be included in the decision letter.

Applicants granted entry clearance or permission to stay in the Skilled Worker route are subject to the following conditions: • they cannot take employment except: o working for the sponsor in the job recorded on their certificate of sponsorship o supplementary employment o voluntary work o working out a contractual notice period for any job they were lawfully working in on the date of application • they have no access to public funds • study (with no limit on the number of study hours if it doesn’t interfere with the job they have been sponsored to do) subject to the restriction below The applicant can do voluntary work in any sector. ‘Voluntary work’ has the same meaning as applies to a voluntary worker as described in section 44 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. For clarity, this means that the person must be employed by a charity, a voluntary organisation, an associated fund-raising body or a statutory body (as defined in that section). They must not be paid or receive other money for the voluntary work, except reasonable expenses as described in that section. The Skilled Worker is allowed to study, but they must obtain an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate for the course or research they intend to undertake and present it to their education provider before they start their study if: • they are not a national of the countries listed in Appendix ATAS 3.1 • their course is in a subject listed in Appendix ATAS 4.1 and it either: o leads to a master’s degree o leads to a PhD o leads to another postgraduate qualification o is a period of study or research which is part of an overseas postgraduate qualification If their course (or research) completion date is postponed or delayed for more than 3 calendar months or there are any changes to the course contents (or the research proposal), they must apply for a new ATAS certificate within 28 calendar days and must provide a printout of the new certificate to their education provider promptly.

Applicants and their sponsors should provide all the necessary evidence and information with the application and certificate of sponsorship (CoS). If, however, there is a clear error or omission, it may be appropriate for you to discuss the application with a manager or technical expert to consider contacting the applicant and / or their sponsor to invite them to provide additional evidence or information. Taking a fair and proportionate approach to assessment of evidence You must review the information on the application form and other available evidence before deciding whether you are satisfied on the balance of probabilities (it is more likely than not) a requirement is met.

Where evidence is missing or inadequate The applicant will be told what evidence to provide as part of the application process. However, sometimes evidence is missing or inadequate to enable you to assess whether the financial requirement is met. You should consider seeking further information or making verification checks when, for example: • evidence is missing (for example a missing page from a series) and you believe the applicant has, or could obtain it • evidence is inadequate, but could be clarified, for example: if a letter from an official financial sponsor does not include all the information you would expect You should check any discrepancies about information on the CoS with the sponsor. You may decide to ask for further information from the applicant, sponsor, or issuing institution (for example: the bank which issued the applicant’s financial documents) or make verification checks in other cases it would help assess whether the requirements are met. If you are not sure whether this would help, you should discuss this with a manager. When contacting the applicant or sponsor, they should be given 10 UK working days in which to provide a response. You do not need to contact the applicant or sponsor if evidence is missing or inadequate, if: • you do not need the information because you can find it elsewhere, for example: from the certificate of sponsorship • receiving it would make no difference to the decision (for example because you would still refuse the application for other reasons) If the evidence supplied is inadequate, you do not have to offer the applicant an opportunity to provide different evidence. For example: if the applicant provides bank statements and they do not show the required level of funds or the evidence is not sufficient, you do not need to check whether the applicant has another bank account which might meet the requirement. Failure to supply requested information If you request additional information from the applicant or their sponsor, you should ask them to provide it, or an explanation why they are unable to, within 10 working days of the date you send the request letter."

This is consistent with the differential rate that sponsors currently pay for a Skilled Worker sponsor licence. If the sponsor does not pay the charge or does not pay the right amount, the CoS is not valid.

Before considering any application, the caseworker must check the application is valid by referring to: • the validity requirements for the Student route, contained in Appendix Student ST 1.1 to 1.5 • the validity requirements for the Child Student route, contained in Appendix Child Student CS 1.1 to 1.5 • the validity requirements for dependants of a Student, contained in Appendix Student ST 28.1 to 28.4 Detailed guidance on how to assess the validity requirements can be found in the Validation, variation, voiding and withdrawing of applications guidance. The caseworker must conduct verification checks if they have any doubts about whether the supporting documents an applicant has submitted are genuine. If an applicant has previously had official financial sponsorship from a government or international sponsorship agency, covering both course fees and living costs, it is a validation requirement that they must obtain consent from the financial sponsor to a further application for permission to study in the UK as a Student being made within 12 months of completing that course, or within 12 months of the award of that scholarship if the application is under Child Student. If it is unclear whether a scholarship meets the threshold for requiring consent for future extensions of permission the caseworker may wish to review conditions of the sponsorship / scholarship. Representatives If an applicant has a UK based representative, the caseworker must check that the representative is approved to provide immigration advice with either: • the Immigration Advice Authority • one of the following designated authorities: o the Law Society o the Law Society of Scotland o the Law Society of Northern Ireland • the General Council of the Bar"

Switching into Student An applicant who is in the UK and applying to switch into the Student route is unable to do so if they have, or have last been granted, permission on any of the routes listed in Appendix Student ST 1.4. If an applicant has been granted outside the Immigration Rules, for the explicit purpose of finding a new student sponsor, they are able to exceptionally switch into the Student route. This applies to applicants who have been granted outside the Immigration Rules who have been cleared of cheating on a TOEIC English language test. There may be other reasons that someone granted permission outside of the Immigration Rules should be allowed to switch into the Student route, and this should be considered on a case by case basis. Any applicant who makes a valid application and is in the UK on the basis of immigration bail documentation should be refused under the suitability requirement. Switching into Child Student An applicant who is in the UK and applying to switch into the Child Student route is unable to do so if they have, or have last been granted, permission on any of the routes listed in Appendix Child Student CS 1.5. An applicant who is applying to switch into the Child Student route must be below 18 years of age. An applicant who is in the UK on the basis of immigration bail documentation cannot switch into the Child Student route. Dependants of overseas diplomats The Home Office sometimes receives applications from foreign embassies to exceptionally allow dependants of overseas diplomats to switch into the Student or Child Student routes. These applicants should be allowed to switch by the caseworker. Related content Contents"

Entry clearance and permission to stay applications For an applicant to qualify as a Student, or as a Child Student who is 16 or 17 years old, the caseworker must be satisfied on the balance of probability that the applicant is a genuine student. To assess an applicant’s credibility, the caseworker must consider all of the information provided in the application and, if applicable, in the credibility interview. The caseworker must not refuse an applicant on genuineness grounds without interviewing them, unless: • the application has been refused previously on genuine student grounds, there have been no changes to the material circumstances, or no new evidence has been provided • there have been a significant number of identical or very similar applications, and the caseworker has interviewed a sample of these applicants and is satisfied that they are not genuine and the facts of the case mean that the applicant would not be able to refute the allegation of lacking credibility If, having reviewed the application – including information obtained during the interview – the caseworker is not satisfied on the balance of probability that the applicant is genuine, the application must be refused under the appropriate paragraph of the Immigration Rules. This is paragraph ST.5.1 of Appendix Student for Student applications, or paragraph CS.5.1 of Appendix Child Student for Child Student applications where the applicant is aged 16 or over. If the caseworker refuses an applicant on credibility grounds, they must clearly set out their allegations, reasoning and argument that form the basis for their decision. If a statement made by an applicant is interpretable in different ways, then the caseworker must provide a justification for which way they have interpreted the information. The English language ability of an applicant can be used as a relevant factor in assessing credibility, however, the caseworker must clearly provide a justification in any refusal letter. Credibility: factors to be considered This section lists factors that caseworkers must consider when assessing whether an applicant is a genuine student. This is not an exhaustive checklist of factors, and not all will be appropriate in every case. Caseworkers must also take into account other issues that arise in particular cases."

For in-country applications, the caseworker must complete an interview referral, authorised by their manager, and forward this to the interview administration team who will schedule an interview date and time. Once an interview slot is allocated, the interview team will send a letter to invite the applicant to attend. For out-of-country applications, Entry Clearance Officers (ECOs) must refer to an Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) to authorise the interview. In authorising a decision to consider the genuine student rule, the ECM must take account of risk factors. Interviews may be arranged and conducted in a variety of ways, which will be affected by the location and availability of the applicant. These may include: • a telephone interview where the caseworker must contact the applicant by phone, and ask them if they are able to answer questions about their application (if the applicant confirms that they are happy to continue, then the interview can be conducted) • contacting the applicant by email or telephone to arrange an interview at a designated time and location Where an applicant fails to undertake an interview without a reasonable explanation as to why they are unable to do so, the caseworker must consider whether to refuse the application under Part Suitability relating to the failure to attend the interview (paragraph SUI 14.1(a) for entry clearance applications or permission to stay applications).

The academic progression requirement is in place to ensure that students are progressing academically if they wish to study a further course in the UK and are not just seeking to extend their stay in the UK. The requirement only applies to students who have previously been granted permission as a Student or a Tier 4 (General) Student and are applying for permission to stay. The rules for the academic progression requirement can be found at Appendix Student ST 14.1 to 14.5. Exemptions An applicant does not need to show academic progression under the exemptions listed in Appendix Student ST 14.4. If an applicant is exempt from demonstrating academic progression, the licensed student sponsor must confirm this, and set out why, in the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS). The caseworker may request further evidence from the Student sponsor to confirm that an applicant is exempt. If an applicant is applying in the UK under the differentiation arrangements, or applying with a higher education provider (HEP) with a track record of compliance, they do not need to send in further evidence with their application that they have completed their previous course. However, their sponsor must specify in the CAS that the applicant has completed their previous course. The caseworker may request further evidence of this when making a decision. The sponsor must state on the CAS if an applicant is applying for the purpose of re- sitting or repeating examinations or modules, or if an applicant has already resat or repeated examinations or modules. If the applicant has previously changed their course of study without completing their previous course (having met the relevant requirements in the rules to do so), to support their new application, they must now submit transcripts to show that they have previously sat the exam or exams or taken the module or modules in respect of the course they changed to, not the previous course. Applicants making a Student application from overseas are not required to show academic progression. When assessing these applications, the caseworker does not need to ensure that the new course is at a higher level than the student’s previous course in the UK.

In these circumstances the caseworker must check that the sponsor has undertaken an assessment of the applicant’s academic ability to complete the higher level course before they assigned the CAS, and that the sponsor has confirmed that they did this in the CAS. If an assessment has not taken place, the caseworker must refer the sponsor for compliance action. As above, if an applicant’s new course is at a lower level than their previous course, it will not represent academic progression, and the caseworker must refuse the application. The caseworker must confirm academic progression has been met by checking that the course is a fully integrated course, it cannot be 2 separate courses at the same sponsor, even if they are placed back to back. For example, an applicant must undertake an integrated master’s course, rather than a separate bachelor’s and master’s course in the period of the permission. To grant permission, the caseworker must be satisfied that the course is integrated. If the caseworker is not satisfied, then they must either request further information or refuse permission."

To establish whether an applicant can use this exemption, the caseworker must consider all of the relevant factors, including the following points (please note, this is not an exhaustive list, and will not be appropriate in every case): • the level of the course • the subject matter of the new and previous courses • the applicant’s education history • the credibility of the applicant’s rationale for wishing to study the new course • whether the HEP sponsor sufficiently explains why the applicant is applying to study a course at the same level, instead of moving up an academic level If an applicant has left an integrated master’s or PhD programme having successfully completed the course leading to the award of the lower level of the 2 qualifications it would be possible to be awarded by completing the course and is applying for a new course at the higher level (for example, a student who exits an integrated masters programme with a bachelors qualification then applies for a masters programme after exiting the course with the lower qualification) they are able to make an in- country application for permission to stay.

Full details of the requirements which need to be met for a sponsor to issue a combined Certificate of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) for the main course of study and the pre-sessional course, can be found in Appendix Student ST 15 and Appendix Child Student CS 11. A pre-sessional course is one that prepares a student for their intended full-time course of study in the UK. This will usually be supplementary English Language training and might also give some background on the British education system to students. Courses such as foundation degrees, which are designed to give a student fundamental training in the subject area of the main course, and courses which form an integral part of the main course of study or replace part of it, are not considered pre-sessional courses. If the caseworker cannot grant for both the pre-sessional and main course because one of the requirements has not been met, providing all other requirements are met, they must contact the licenced student sponsor to confirm that the sponsor is willing to sponsor the applicant for the pre-sessional course only. If the licenced Student sponsor agrees, the caseworker must grant for the pre- sessional course plus the additional one month period. If the licenced Student sponsor does not agree, the caseworker must refuse the application.

Generally, these arrangements will be defined as: • ‘full-time’ is when a student lives at school for all of term-time • ‘weekly’ is when a student lives at school during the week, but stays elsewhere at the weekend • ‘flexi’ is when a student lives at school on a changeable basis. They may stay at school for an entire week and then the following week stay elsewhere or they may board for a couple of days each week and stay elsewhere the rest of the week However, sponsoring schools may have a slightly different interpretation of these categories of boarding arrangements, and allowance for this should be made in your consideration. Regardless of the arrangement, it is acceptable for students to stay with their parents in the UK outside of term-time (for example, if they are visiting the UK), return home, or stay in school, provided the school is still open with staff members present. Child Students are also able to attend a school trip or stay with a friend for the weekend, provided they have consent of their parents or legal guardian. Where a Child Student is boarding, they must also demonstrate that their non- boarding living arrangements meet the requirements. Guardianship organisation In the introductory section of the Immigration Rules, a guardianship organisation is defined as an organisation, with the approval of the Child Student’s parent, legal guardian or school, that arranges a nominated guardian for the child. Guardianship organisations may refer to these care arrangements with nominated guardians as homestays. Where this language is used instead, this does not impact the application. Guardianship organisations sometimes act in further capacities in addition to facilitating care arrangements, for example, liaising between the Child Student and their school or family. Nominated guardian A nominated guardian is someone who cares for a child for less than 28 continuous days and / or is the school’s emergency contact in the UK for the child. They must be"

A nominated guardian cannot be a private foster carer, close relative, or the Child Student’s parent or legal guardian who has permission as a Parent of a Child Student. Where the Child Student is boarding at school, their nominated guardian cannot be a member of staff at their sponsoring school. Other adults regularly living with a nominated guardian An individual will be considered to regularly living with a nominated guardian if they are an adult who resides at their property or stays at the household on a regular basis. This would include, for example, anyone whose primary home is elsewhere but spends a significant amount of time at the nominated guardian’s home. Close relatives A close relative caring for the child is not considered to be a private foster carer and so will not need to register with a UK local authority. A close relative is a person aged 18 or over who is the child’s: • grandparent • brother • sister • step-parent • uncle (the brother or half-brother of the child’s parent) • aunt (the sister or half-sister of the child’s parent) Parents accompanying children under 12 Parents who wish to accompany their children to the UK can apply to do so under the Parent of a Child Student route. Children under the age of 12 can be accompanied by one parent, who will be responsible for the care of the child within the UK. Children aged 12 and over are only able to reside with their parent if that parent holds a Parent of a Child Student permission issued on the basis of a younger sibling who has permission as a Child Student. Private foster care Children under 16 years old (or under 18 years old if disabled) are privately fostered when they are cared for on a full-time basis for 28 continuous days or more by adults, who are not their parents, legal guardians or a close relative. It is the responsibility of the parent, carer, and anyone else involved in making the private fostering arrangement, including the licensed Student sponsor, to notify their UK local authority of the private fostering arrangement."

Student: grant of permission If the applicant meets the requirements of Appendix Student of the Immigration Rules, the caseworker must grant permission to stay with the appropriate work and study conditions. Students are able to travel outside of, and re-enter, the UK whilst they hold valid permission as a Student, including in the period after they have completed their course and still hold permission under the route. For more information on the hours that a Student can work, see: Student: employment. Student: period to grant The period of permission to be granted to an applicant is dependent on the length and type of course to be studied. Information on the periods of permission to be granted after the end of the course can be found in Appendix Student ST 25.3. In cases where an extension of permission to stay is granted after the course has finished, the caseworker must grant the additional period after the course stated in Appendix Student ST 25.3, from the date of decision. However, for courses where the caseworker would usually grant an additional period of 7 days, they must grant 17 days from the date of decision, if the course has finished. Student: period to grant for courses comprising separate, independent modules For applications for permission to study courses such as the Association of Business Executives (ABE) or other courses that are made up of a series of independent modules, the applicant must submit a separate Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) for each module of the course being studied. The caseworker must only grant permission up to the end date of the stage that is provided by the sponsor, plus any relevant additional permission (unless it is an Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) or Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) course and the CAS specifies that it should be treated as one, long course). This may lead to a period of greater than one month passing between modules and the applicant having to leave the UK to make an application for their next module. Licenced Student sponsors offering Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) courses must be an ACCA ‘approved learning partner’."

This will not be considered a breach of the professional sportsperson restrictions.

A Child Student is not permitted to be self-employed or engage in business activity. A Student must not fill a full-time, permanent vacancy unless the conditions in Appendix Student ST 26.6 apply. A Child Student is not permitted to fill a permanent vacancy. A Student or Child Student must not be employed as a professional sportsperson (including coach), whether paid or not and where one or more of the indicators of the definition provided under paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules applies. A Student or Child Student must not be employed as an entertainer. Volunteering Students and Child Students can volunteer while they are studying. Voluntary work is distinct from volunteering. A Student can do voluntary work if they are permitted to work, but this work and any paid work must not exceed the total number of hours they are permitted to work during term time. For example, if a student is permitted to work 20 hours a week during term-time and has paid work of 15 hours a week, they cannot do more than 5 hours voluntary work. If they are not permitted to work, they cannot do voluntary work. Child Students aged 16 and over can undertake voluntary work. Factors to take into account when considering whether a particular activity constitutes voluntary work or volunteering are: • voluntary workers will usually have contractual obligations to perform the work (for example to attend at particular times and carry out specific tasks) with the employer being contractually required to provide the work – the contract does not have to be written - the worker is usually remunerated in kind • volunteers do not have a contract - they must not be a substitute for an employee, and they must not be doing unpaid work – for example, receiving payment in kind (although they are sometimes reimbursed for reasonable travel and subsistence expenses) • volunteers usually help a charity or voluntary or public sector organisation Related content Contents"

Dependant partners and dependant children are not required to apply at the same time as the Student, they can also apply for entry clearance to join the Student in the UK, or for permission to stay as a dependant, at a later date. If a dependant partner and/or dependant child is applying as the dependant of a Student who has already been granted permission within the UK, all dependants should be granted in line with the end date of the Student’s permission. A dependant application can only be granted where the main applicant already holds or is at the same time being granted permission as a Student. Where the main applicant that the dependant is applying with or to join has their application decided but is not granted permission, the dependant will not meet paragraph ST 32. The dependant application will therefore be refused Switching An applicant who is in the UK and applying to switch into the Student route as a dependant is unable to do so if they have, or have last been granted, permission on any of the routes listed in Appendix Student ST 28.4. There may be other reasons that someone in those circumstances should be allowed to switch into the Student route as a dependant, and this should be considered on a case by case basis."

The following people are eligible for permission as a dependant of a person who has been granted permission as a Student, or who will be applying at the same time: • spouses • civil partners • unmarried partners • dependent children of either a Student or their partner under the age of 18 The following Students are allowed to have dependants with them in the UK: • Students who have a scholarship or sponsorship from a government to study a full-time course lasting 6 months or longer • Students studying above degree level at a higher education provider with a track record of compliance on a course lasting 9 months or longer and, if the course start date is on or after 1 January 2024, the provider has confirmed the course is a PhD or other doctoral qualification, or a research-based higher degree • Students who have permission, or had permission within the last 3 months to study on a full-time course of 6 months or longer, and who are now applying for permission to study a full-time course of 6 months or longer where either: o the partner or child applying has been the Student’s dependant in that period o the child applying was born since the last grant of permission to the Student and they are applying at the same time as the Student or the dependant partner • Students whose child was born in a timeframe set out at Appendix Student ST 31.2 are allowed to have that child as a dependant with them in the UK Where Appendix Student refers to ’government’ this should be understood to be consistent with the requirement of Appendix Finance in the context of acceptable providers of official financial sponsorship, namely that it must be His Majesty’s Government or the applicant’s national government. In order to be eligible to bring dependants through holding a government scholarship or sponsorship the award must be a government funded scholarship or sponsorship from a national government department. In practice this means that it must be the government who is providing the funds that are relied on, setting the eligibility criteria which must be met and assessing whether the recipient has met those criteria. Where the sponsorship is from a separate body, or where some of those actions are completed by a body other than the government, it would not meet the criteria. His Majesty’s Government runs several scholarship schemes including: • Marshall Scholarship • Chevening Scholars • Commonwealth Shared Scholarship Scheme"

        "content": "• Fulbright Scholarships • International Association for Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IAESTE) Please note, this list is not exhaustive, and other HM Government sponsored programmes may exist. Where the applicant is relying on a scholarship issued by the government of another country it is for the applicant to demonstrate, usually via a letter of confirmation from the official financial sponsor, that the award is granted from a national government. Scholarships and sponsorships may on occasion be awarded using different terminology. This should not prevent the applicant from meeting the requirement, as long as the evidence provided refers to a financial award issued by a national government for the purpose of completing a course of study which meets the requirements of the student route. The scholarship or sponsorship is not required to cover the full fees and living costs of the student in order to permit them to sponsor dependants. However, if this is the case, the applicant must provide separate financial evidence to demonstrate that they meet the financial requirement. If a scholarship does not cover the living costs for any dependants of the student then the applicant must provide separate financial evidence to cover them. Students applying with a combined CAS for integrated programmes comprising of an integrated pre master and research master programme will meet the requirement to bring dependants. The sponsor should confirm on the CAS which the Student’s current permission relies on whether the course of study is a PhD or other doctoral qualification, or a research-based higher degree or not. This will be done via the Academic Course Level field as follows: • RQF_7 / SCQF_11 will denote a ‘taught’ course • RQF_7_Research / SCQF_11_Research will denote a Research course • RQF_8 / SCQF_12 will denote a ‘taught’ course • RQF_8_Research / SCQF_12_Research will denote a Research course You may write out for this information if it is not otherwise provided. To be considered a ‘research-based higher degree’ the course of study must meet the definition of a ‘research-based higher degree’ in Paragraph 6.2(b) of the Immigration rules: ‘Research-based higher degree’ means a postgraduate programme comprising a research component (including a requirement to produce original work) that is larger than any accompanying taught component when measured by student effort.”"
