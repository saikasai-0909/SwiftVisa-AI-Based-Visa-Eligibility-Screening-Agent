If you doubt the evidence provided to meet any of the relationship requirements, you may request an applicant attends an interview. Where an applicant fails to undertake an interview without a reasonable explanation as to why they are unable to do so, you must consider whether to refuse the application on grounds for refusal related to the failure to attend the interview (Part Suitability). The interview can only be rearranged if an applicant gives adequate reasons as to why they cannot attend the interview, and the interview team are reasonably satisfied with these reasons.
