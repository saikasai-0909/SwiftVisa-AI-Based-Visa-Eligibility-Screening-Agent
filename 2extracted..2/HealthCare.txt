After 5 years, you may be able to apply to settle permanently in the UK
(/settle-in-the-uk/y/tier-2-general-visa-or-skilled-worker-visa) (also known as
‘indefinite leave to remain’). This gives you the right to live, work and study
here for as long as you like, and apply for benefits if you’re eligible.
How to apply
You must apply online.
How you apply depends on whether you’re:
outside the UK (/health-care-worker-visa/apply-from-outside-the-uk) and are
coming to the UK
inside the UK and extending your current visa (/health-care-worker-
visa/extend-your-visa)
inside the UK and switching from a different visa (/health-care-worker-
visa/switch-to-this-visa)
If you want to change your job or employer, you must apply to update your
visa (/health-care-worker-visa/update-your-visa-if-you-change-job-or-employer).
Your partner and children (/health-care-worker-visa/your-partner-and-children)
may be able to apply to join you or stay in the UK as your ‘dependants’.
How long it takes
You can apply for a visa up to 3 months before the day you are due to start
work in the UK. This date is listed on your certificate of sponsorship.
As part of your application, you’ll need to prove your identity and provide
your documents.
You may need to allow extra time if you need an appointment to do this.
You’ll find out if you need one when you start your application.
Getting a decision
Once you’ve applied online, proved your identity and provided your
documents, you’ll usually get a decision on your visa within 3 weeks.
You may be able to pay to get a faster decision (/faster-decision-visa-
settlement).

uk/getting-a-decision-on-your-application) will tell you what you’ll get to prove
